 \item Training data are points obtained in the random motor babbling experiment
 \item $\mathbf{x_p}$ is a 3D or 4D data point corresponding to hands or joint positions 
 \item $\mathbf{w_i}$ are weights of a neuron $i$, in the beginning initialized randomly 
 \item Gaussian neighbourhood function:
\begin{equation}
h(i, j)=e^{-\frac{\left(\mathbf{w_i}-\mathbf{w_j}\right)^2}{2\pi\sigma(t)^2}}

\item Pick a winning neuron as the one with the smallest Euclidean distance to the data point: 
  \begin{equation}
    \underset{i}{\arg\min} || \mathbf{x_p}-\mathbf{w_i} ||
  \end{equation}

\item Adjust weights of all neurons based on the winning neuron using the learning rate $\eta(t)$ and neighbourhood function $h(i,j)$:
  \begin{equation}
    \Delta \mathbf{w_{j}} = \eta(t) h(i, j) (\mathbf{w_{j}}-\mathbf{x_p})
  \end{equation}

  \item The learning rate $\eta$ and the spread of Gaussian function $\sigma$ are annealed exponentially after the first half of iterations
