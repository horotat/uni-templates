% This is "sig-alternate.tex" V2.0 May 2012
% This file should be compiled with V2.5 of "sig-alternate.cls" May 2012
%
% This example file demonstrates the use of the 'sig-alternate.cls'
% V2.5 LaTeX2e document class file. It is for those submitting
% articles to ACM Conference Proceedings WHO DO NOT WISH TO
% STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE SIGS (PUBS-BOARD-ENDORSED) STYLE.
% The 'sig-alternate.cls' file will produce a similar-looking,
% albeit, 'tighter' paper resulting in, invariably, fewer pages.
%
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V2.5) produces:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) NO page numbers
%
% as against the acm_proc_article-sp.cls file which
% DOES NOT produce 1) thru' 3) above.
%
% Using 'sig-alternate.cls' you have control, however, from within
% the source .tex file, over both the CopyrightYear
% (defaulted to 200X) and the ACM Copyright Data
% (defaulted to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX).
% e.g.
% \CopyrightYear{2007} will cause 2007 to appear in the copyright line.
% \crdata{0-12345-67-8/90/12} will cause 0-12345-67-8/90/12 to appear in the copyright line.
%
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex source is an example which *does* use
% the .bib file (from which the .bbl file % is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission, you *NEED* to 'insert'
% your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.

\begin{abstract}
Hand-eye coordination is an important motor skill acquired in infancy which precedes pointing behavior. Pointing facilitates social interactions by directing attention of engaged participants. It is thus essential for the natural flow of human-robot interaction. Here, we attempt to explain how pointing emerges from sensorimotor learning of hand-eye coordination in a humanoid robot. During a body babbling phase with a random walk strategy, a robot learned mappings of joints for different arm postures. Arm joint configurations were used to train biologically inspired models consisting of SOMs. We show that such a model implemented on a robotic platform accounts for pointing behavior while humans present objects out of reach of the robot's hand.

\section{Introduction}
Hand-eye coordination is an important motor skill acquired in infancy which precedes pointing behavior. Pointing facilitates social interactions by directing attention of engaged participants. It is thus essential for the natural flow of human-robot interaction. Here, we attempt to explain how pointing emerges from sensorimotor learning of hand-eye coordination in a humanoid robot. During a body babbling phase with a random walk strategy, a robot learned mappings of joints for different arm postures. Arm joint configurations were used to train biologically inspired models consisting of SOMs. We show that such a model implemented on a robotic platform accounts for pointing behavior while humans present objects out of reach of the robot's hand.

\section{Biologically inspired model}
Hand-eye coordination is an important motor skill acquired in infancy which precedes pointing behavior. Pointing facilitates social interactions by directing attention of engaged participants. It is thus essential for the natural flow of human-robot interaction. Here, we attempt to explain how pointing emerges from sensorimotor learning of hand-eye coordination in a humanoid robot. During a body babbling phase with a random walk strategy, a robot learned mappings of joints for different arm postures. Arm joint configurations were used to train biologically inspired models consisting of SOMs. We show that such a model implemented on a robotic platform accounts for pointing behavior while humans present objects out of reach of the robot's hand.
